          I am a MERN Stack Developer and Competitive Programmer who loves transforming ideas into real-world
          applications using code. As a final-year B.Tech CSE student, I am eager to begin my professional career
          and apply my skills in full stack development to solve meaningful problems. I have worked on multiple
          projects that demonstrate my ability to build practical, user-focused solutions. I am actively seeking
          opportunities to contribute to industry-level projects, grow as a developer, and continuously improve
          my technical skills while adapting to new challenges.
          <br /><br />
          Below are my skills, tech stack, and projects.
